### Dec.1 2021
* Tried deploy web with heroku, 000webhost and github. -Github is the easiest to use in my opinion.
* BrowserRouter is not supported in github tho, so I changed it to HashRouter. (and changed Routes to Switch)
* The routing still gave me headache, because I don't know why I set path to be '/Teaching' but the actaul routing will be /#Teaching#Teaching
* Tried HashStyle but still didn't actually work. I just left it in this weird way for now.
* Josh's website can be vistied [HERE.](https://jiangyanlineu.github.io/JoshProfolilo/).

 ### Dec.2 2021
* Modified the contents, layout, navbar and added a timelined-react-component based on Josh's feedback. The picky king is satisfied now.
